# dc2diafakepipe
for LSST-DC2-DIA users to stash code that we've been using for planting fake stars (SNe) into LSST DC2 images, producing diff images, measuring detection efficiencies.  Current goal is just to share our separate code so we can see what we're all doing. In the future we might use this to build a single shared pipeline that serves our collective DIA fake-planting need
